Hi!

This project was to experiment with graphQL. 
It uses the V3 SpaceX REST api as an endpoint with express. 
This was just a proof of concept, I have no intension of styling anything so please don't hold that against me!

If you'd like to learn how to use graphQL with react, express and apollo, check out this tutorial I found:
